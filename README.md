# motorcortex-clip-starter

## Purpose

This repository is a starter boilerplate for creating MotorCortex Clips with DCode. Do not use this repo directly. Instead, use it from the **[Donkeyclip CLI](https://github.com/donkeyclip/cli)**

## Structure and Contents

It includes:

- a pre-configured webpack so you don't have to care about setting up your project
- pre-configured eslint and babel
- a "clip" folder in order for you to use to define your Clip and Incidents. The folder
  contains the `clip.js` file which is just a starting point for your Clip.
- a "server" folder that is there just for the needs of viewing, debugging and creating
  your Clip through DCode.

## How to use

Once you've created your new Clip you have the ability to publish it through the [donkeyclip](https://donkeyclip.com) page. You can then embed your clip in any site you want!.

## Commands

- `npm run build`: builds the demo
- `npm start`: builds and starts the demo

## Have fun!!!
